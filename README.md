### 🃏 Stock Game Prototype

A sample JSON file demonstrating two turns of a stock game used to prototype match flow and card logic.

**Path:** `/public/data/gameflow.json`

This file outlines:
- Basic card types (creature and object)
- Turn sequence (draw → play → combat → end turn)
- Example card attributes (HP, range, element, activation cost)
- Example moves and effects

This serves as the foundation for the “default” game users can later modify in the TCG Maker platform.
